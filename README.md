# .Brightness-Control-With-Hand-Detection

* Created a Python project using OpenCV and Mediapipe for hand gesture recognition. <br>
* Developed a HandTracking module to detect hand landmarks and measure distance <br>
* between thumb tip and index fingertip. <br>
* Mapped the distance to adjust system brightness within a 0-100 range <br>
